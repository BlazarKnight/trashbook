# HYPERSIGN
 
THE TRASH MAGIC HYPERSIGN IS TWO THINGS:

 - THE VIRTUAL CARDBOARD, AS WORLD-WRITEABLE HTML, ON A TRASH MAGIC SERVER, WITH TEXT MATCHING THE PHYSICAL CARDBOARD
 - PHYSICAL CARDBOARD SIGN WHICH POINTS TO THE URL OF THE VIRTUAL CARDBOARD


AS ABOVE, SO BELOW!

WHAT IS THE HYPERSIGN FOR? COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PEOPLE CONNECTED TO THE NETWORK CAN CREATE A HYPERSIGN FOR THINGS THEY WANT TO EITHER GET OR GIVE, BE IT GOODS OR SERVICES OR INFORMATION, AND THE HYPERSIGN CAN REPRESENT THAT THING!  OPERATORS PICK THEM UP AND DROP THEM OFF.  THEY ARE ALL DESIGNED TO REPLICATE BOTH FROM THE PHYSICAL TO THE VIRTUAL AND FROM THE VIRTUAL TO THE VIRTUAL AND EACH CAN REPLICATE AGAIN AND AGAIN! 

THE HYPERSIGN IS A MEME THAT IS TRANSMITTED ENTIRELY ON TRASH!

 IT CAN REPRESENT ANYTHING! 

ANY THING, ACTION, PLACE, PERSON, IDEA, FILE, RELATIONSHIP, WORD, DOCUMENT, SYSTEM, OR SET!
