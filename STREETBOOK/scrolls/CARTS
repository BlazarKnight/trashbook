# CARTS
 
WE START WITH ANY BIKE CART AND BUILD SOME KIND OF WEATHER ENCLOSURE, ADD AN INVERTER THAT GOES FROM THE EBIKE SUPPLY TO 120 VAC, AND BUILD A TRASH MAGIC SERVER INTO IT WHICH IS ALSO A TERMINAL AND HAS THE WIFI HOTSPOT!  AND THERE IS SPACE SEPARATE FROM THE SERVER FOR MUTUAL AID SUPPLIES, PICKUPS, DELIVERIES, FREE PRODUCTS, PHYSICAL MEDIA, BATTERIES, SOLAR PANELS, WEB SERVERS BOTH TO DROP OFF AND PICK UP.  
IT'S REALLY JUST A CART!
