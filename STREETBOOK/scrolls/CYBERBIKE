# TRASH MAGIC CYBERBIKE!
 
A CYBERBIKE IS A BIKE WITH A TRASH MAGIC SERVER ON IT!

I BUILD CYBERBIKES FOR MONEY AT UPCYCLE ROBOTICS! CAN BUILD ON EBIKE OR MANUAL BIKE! I TAKE BIKE PARTS AND OLD COMPUTERS AND TURN THEM INTO CYBERBIKES! CYBERBIKES ARE A PUBLIC TERMINAL WITH THE FULL SCIENCE SETUP WITH JUPYTER AND ARDUINO!

THAT'S ALL! AND THEN I'M DONE, MY SYSTEM IS ALIVE AND I CAN START DOING BUILDS. I THEN CAN GET ANYONE WHO CAN DO BUILDS TO JOIN THE COOP! BUT FOR NOW IT'S JUST ME! THIS IS WHAT UPCYCLE ROBOTICS BUILDS SO I CAN SPEND COMPANY MONEY FOR A BUILD AND GET STARTED RIGHT AWAY DOING BUILDS ON EXISTING BIKES AND GET HELP FROM REAL MECHANICS!  THE WHY IS THAT THIS SPREADS THE TRASH MAGIC NETWORK! BUY AND BUILD THE HARDWARE TO GROW THE NETWORK!
