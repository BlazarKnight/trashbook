# SPONSORS
 
SPONSORS SUPPORT THE NETWORK BY PROVIDING AID BOTH TO NETWORK OPERATORS AND TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY SERVED BY THE OPERATORS!  ALL SPONSORS ARE RECRUITED FROM ALONG THE [NETWORK OF ROUTES AND STATIONS](scrolls/ROUTES)!

THESE INCLUDE: 
 
 - FOOD DONATIONS!
 - DONATIONS OF OTHER [MUTUAL AID](scrolls/MUTUALAID) SUPPLIES!
 - DONATIONS OF FREE PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS!
 - ALLOWING TRASH MAGIC OPERATORS TO WORK OR LIVE ON THEIR PROPERTY!
 - EBIKE CHARGE!

WE SUPPORT SPONSORS BY PROMOTING THEM ALONG OUR NETWORK, MAKING THEM FREE BUSINESS WEB PAGES ON OUR [BUSINESS DIRECTORY](scrolls/BUSINESSDIRECTORY)!

WE WILL DISTRIBUTE FOR FREE ANY MEDIA THEY WANT TO DISTRIBUTE TO THE NETWORK, BOTH PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL!

WE DO NOT SIGN CONTRACTS AND MAKE NO GUARANTEES! SUPPORT IS VOLUNTARY!

WE VET ALL SPONSORS FOR BEING BUSINESSES WE VIEW AS ETHICAL AND WHICH DO SOMETHING USEFUL OR AT LEAST NOT EVIL!
