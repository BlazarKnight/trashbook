# DOWNSTREAM
 
FROM THE SOUTH PLATTE, WE WILL CONNECT THE NETWORK DOWNSTREAM TO THE PLATTE THROUGH NEBRASKA AND THEN TO THE MISSOURI RIVER AND THEN TO THE MISSSISSIPPI AND FINALLY OUT ALONG THE GULF COAST! WHEN THE NETWORK REACHES THE OCEAN, WE WILL FEED IT BACK THE OTHER WAY, AND BUILD MORE AN MORE ROUTES WHERE OPERATORS RIDE THEIR BIKES UP AND DOWN ALONG THE WATERSHED!  

WE WILL REPEAT THIS PROCESS BOTH DOWNSTREAM AND  UPSTREAM FROM EVERY CREEK, RIVER, LAKE, POND, GULF, SWAMP, BAYOU, CANAL AND SLOUGH FOR THE WHOLE PLANET!
