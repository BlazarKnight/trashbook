# MAGICDUMP
 
THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SERVERS ON WHICH WE SHARE OUR FREE DOCUMENTS ARE HOSTED ON THE "MAGIC DUMP"!

THIS IS THE FREE ALTERNATIVE TO THE CLOUD!

THE MAGIC DUMP IS ALL ON MACHINES WITH NO PRIVATE DATA ON THEM AT ALL!  

ALL SERVERS RUN A FREE OS!

WE ATTEMPT TO GET SERVERS FROM WASTE STREAMS, BUT TAKE WASTE STREAM LIBERALLY TO INCLUDE ALL KINDS OF RANDOM CONSUMER THINGS WE CAN GET OUR HANDS ON INCLUDING RASPBERRY PI AND OTHER SINGLE BOARD COMPUTERS!

A "DUMP DIRECTOR" IS A SERVER RUNNING NGINX PROXY MANAGER WHICH DIRECTS INCOMING TRAFFIC TO ALL THE OTHER SERVERS!

ANYONE ON THE NETWORK CAN VOLUNTEER TO HOST A MAGIC DUMP, AND TRASH MAGIC OPERATORS WILL SET THEM UP ON HOME OR BUSINESS INTERNET CONNECTIONS!

ALL SERVERS IN THE WORLD CAN REPLICATE CYBERMAGIC SETS FROM ALL SERVERS ON MAGIC DUMPS!

TO REPLICATE FROM A FIELD SERVER TO A MAGIC DUMP, GO TO THE SAME HOME WIFI NETWORK AS THE MAGIC DUMP AND REPLICATE USING THE IP ADDRESS!
