# MACHINE LEARNING!
 
WE WANT TO OPTIMIZE THIS DOCUMENT, THE BOOK OF TRASH, FOR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PHYSICAL SERVERS WHICH ARE ON THE NETWORK OF SELF-REPLICATING DOCUMENTS!

WE INVITE CYBER MAGIC PRACITIONERS TO USE PHP TO CREATE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS WHICH CAN BE EDITED AND CONTROLLED FROM THE CLIENT SIDE OF THE BROWSER!

WE WILL WRITE ALGORITHMS WHICH TELL PEOPLE ABOUT WRITING ALGORITHMS AND WHICH ALSO TELL THEM ABOUT USING CODE WHICH REPLICATES THE WHOLE SET OF CODE AND DOCUMENTS!

ALGORITHMS ARE BUILT FOR TOTAL DIRECT CONTROL BY THE HUMAN USER SWARM IN REAL TIME!

THE HUMAN TRASHNET SWARM WILL INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO GAIN ACCESS TO IT WASTE STREAMS WHICH CAN BE USED TO PUT MORE SERVERS ON THE NETWORK!

THIS PARTICULAR DOCUMENT RIGHT HERE IS A SELF-REPLICATING AND EVOLVING LIVING THING!

THIS DOCUMENT ASKS YOU TO WRITE THE COMPUTER PROGRAMS WHICH WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY INDUCE THE DOCUMENT TO GET PEOPLE TO WRITE COMPUTER PROGRAMS WHICH INCREASE ITS POWER TO REPLICATE SERVERS MADE FROM TRASH WHICH CARRY BOOKS ABOUT MAKING SELF-REPLICATING MEDIA FROM TRASH!
