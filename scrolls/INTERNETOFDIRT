# INTERNET OF DIRT!
 
CREATE CUBES FROM CARDBOARD AND USE THEM AS THE ELEMENTS OF A NETWORK OF DIRT, ROCKS, COMPOST, AND SMALL TRASH BITS, WHICH ARE TRANSPORTED USING THE [TRASHCARTS](scrolls/TRASHCARTS)! 

GATHER CONTAINERS FROM WASTE STREAMS SUCH AS BOTTLES, BOXES, BUCKETS, BINS, DUMPSTERS, DUMP TRUCKS, WHEELBARROWS, BARGES, PICKUP TRUCKS, AND TRASH DALEKS AND PUT DIRT AND ROCKS AND TRASH IN THEM AND MOVE THEM AROUND!

BUILD DIRT ROUTERS WHERE AUTOMATED ROUTING ON THE INTERNET OF DIRT CAN FACILITATE LARGE SCALE AUTOMATED GROWTH OF BOTH FOOD AND TECHNOLOGY CROPS OF BOTH PLANS AND FUNGI!
