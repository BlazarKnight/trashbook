# Upcycle Robotics

We teach people how to build self-replicating media from trash.  

In order to self-replicate, media must seize people's attention and give them a reason to copy it, and then must provide all the needed instructions for how to actually copy it. 

We operate from an understanding that all science and technology are forms of language. Language is how the mind parses reality, it is the glass our minds must look through in order to perceive both the physical world and each other.  Technology is the set of languages which we use to impose our will on the physical world.  

At Upcycle Robotics(UR) we aim to build simple relationships between content creators and their sponsors.  We want to replace the role of "platform" with that of teachers of the language of freely replicating technology.  

In platform-based social media, both the physical infrastructure and the intellectual property of communication are owned by a single corporation, which taxes all of the flow through the social network.  In free social media, technology creators are just another type of content creator, and we form collaborations with other content creators to create content which generates attention which replicates the trash technology.  This seizing of attention can be leveraged to get support for the network from both companies looking to promote their brand and individual sponsors who support the mission of a free world built from trash.
