***THE TRASHBOOK IS THE FIRST REALLY FREE EBOOK EVER!***

NOTHING ON THE CLOUD IS FREE!

NOTHING FROM THE APP STORE IS FREE!

NOTHING WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION ON IT IS FREE!

IPHONE IS NOT FREE!

ANDROID IS NOT FREE!

THIS IS THE WORLDS FIRST FREE EBOOK BECAUSE IT IS MADE OF TRASH AND REPLICATES ITSELF TO MORE TRASH!

THIS BOOK EATS TRASH!

EVERY TIME THIS BOOK REPLICATES, MORE TRASH IS CONSUMED!

THIS BOOK CONSISTS OF SELF-REPLICATING CODE, SELF-REPLICATING WEB SERVERS FROM TRASH, SELF-REPLICATING SIGNS ON CARDBOARD TRASH, AND SELF-REPLICATING CARTS WHICH MOVE TRASH IN THE STREET NETWORKS!
