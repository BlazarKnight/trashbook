INSTALLERS!

INSTALLERS ARE PEOPLE WITH BASIC LINUX SKILLS WHO CAN INSTALL TRASH MAGIC SERVERS ON COMPUTERS WE GET FROM THE VARIOUS [SOURCES](scrolls/SOURCING)!

INSTALLERS TRAIN OTHER INSTALLERS!

INSTALLERS MAKE AND SHARE LINUX INSTALL DISKS, BOTH USB THUMB DRIVES AND DVD/CD ROM INSTALL DISKS!

INSTALLERS HAVE A SHIPPING ADDRESS OR KNOW SOMEONE WITH A SHIPPING ADDRESS OR PICKUP OR DROP OFF LOCATION WHERE DONORS AND SPONSORS CAN DELIVER MACHINES TO INSTALL SERVERS ON!
