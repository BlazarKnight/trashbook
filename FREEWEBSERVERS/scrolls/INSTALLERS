INSTALLERS!

INSTALLERS ARE PEOPLE WITH BASIC LINUX SKILLS WHO CAN INSTALL TRASH MAGIC SERVERS ON COMPUTERS WE GET FROM THE VARIOUS [SOURCES](scrolls/SOURCING)!

INSTALLERS TRAIN OTHER INSTALLERS!

INSTALLERS MAKE AND SHARE LINUX INSTALL DISKS, BOTH USB THUMB DRIVES AND DVD/CD ROM INSTALL DISKS!

INSTALLERS HAVE A SHIPPING ADDRESS OR KNOW SOMEONE WITH A SHIPPING ADDRESS OR PICKUP OR DROP OFF LOCATION WHERE DONORS AND SPONSORS CAN DELIVER MACHINES TO INSTALL SERVERS ON!
 
TO GET STARTED AS AN INSTALLER, TRY INSTALLING UBUNTU FROM THE INSTRUCTIONS ON [UBUNTU.COM](https://www.ubuntu.com).  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHOICES, AND THEY SHOULD ALL WORK!

THIS IS A FREE AND OPEN SYSTEM! 

IT IS NOT PROPERTY!

PUT NO PRIVATE DATA ON IT!

DO NOT LOG INTO PRIVATE SYSTEM!

USE AN OBVIOUS LOGIN AND PASSWORD AND PUT IT ON THE PHYSICAL BODY OF THE MACHINE IN PAINT PEN!  

DECORATE THE MACHINE USING MAXIMALIST ARTS AND CRAFTS!

MAKE IT LOOK WEIRD!

TO DO AN INSTALL OF THE TRASH MAGIC SERVER, FOLLOW ANY OF THE VARIOUS TRASH MAGIC INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS [THE ONE FOR THE CARDBOARD HYPERSIGN HERE](https://www.github.com/lafelabs/HYPERSIGN).
